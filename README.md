ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Khatir Hussain!

ðŸŽ“ Computer Science Student | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Data Science Enthusiast

ðŸ’» Passionate about exploring the realms of Machine Learning and Data Science, I'm a dedicated Computer Science student pursuing a BS degree. My journey has allowed me to dive deep into the fascinating world of Java, Python, C++, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

ðŸ”¬ Currently, I am focusing on two exciting areas of study: Compiler Construction and Machine Learning. Through Compiler Construction, I'm gaining insights into the intricacies of designing and building efficient compilers, while Machine Learning captivates me with its ability to uncover patterns and make intelligent predictions from data.

ðŸš€ In addition, I am actively working on a Resume Scanning based e-recruitment model using ML. By leveraging the power of Machine Learning, I aim to develop a system that automates the resume screening process, helping recruiters save time and identify the most qualified candidates efficiently.

ðŸ”§ My tech stack includes: Java, Python, C++, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and more. I love learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science.

ðŸ“š When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me engrossed in research papers, experimenting with new algorithms, or participating in data science competitions. I value continuous learning and strive to expand my knowledge through personal projects and collaborations.

ðŸ“« Let's connect and collaborate! Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or through my LinkedIn profile [https://www.linkedin.com/in/kh-turi-31499b173]. I'm open to discussions, sharing ideas, and exploring new opportunities in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science.

ðŸŒŸ Together, let's harness the power of data and shape a smarter, more connected world through cutting-edge technology. Let's revolutionize the recruitment process through AI-powered solutions.
